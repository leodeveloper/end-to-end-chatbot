# End-to-End Chat Bot for Local SQL Database CSV

This project aims to develop an end-to-end chat bot system that interacts with a local SQL database CSV file. The system utilizes Streamlit for creating interactive web applications, LangChain for natural language processing (NLP), and ChromeDB for managing the SQL database. The entire system is implemented in Python.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Provides a user-friendly chat interface for interacting with the database.
- **Query Processing**: Parses natural language queries and converts them into SQL queries.
- **Database Interaction**: Performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the local SQL database CSV file.
- **Streamlit Web Application**: Presents the chat bot interface as a web application using Streamlit.
- **NLP Integration**: Utilizes LangChain for processing natural language queries.
- **Easy Deployment**: Streamlit allows for easy deployment of the web application.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the entire project.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web application.
- **LangChain**: NLP library for processing natural language queries.
- **ChromeDB**: Python library for managing the local SQL database CSV file.
